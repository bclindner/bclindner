# Grading Web Tools

This repository contains an HTML/CSS validator frontend and a plagiarism checker service developed to help streamline my work grading labs as a tutor at Georgia Southern. These services are no longer in use. and I cannot guarantee that they work.

It used the W3C HTML validator API, and CSSHint on the backend.
